{title:Description}

{pstd}{bf:hrr} generates a map of United States hospital referer regions (HRRs), which "represent regional health care markets for tertiary medical care".{p_end}

{pstd}HRRs were defined and constructed by the Dartmouth Atlas, using a process described briefly on {browse "http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/tools/faq/researchmethods.aspx":their Research Methods webpage},
and in more detail in their {browse "http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/downloads/methods/geogappdx.pdf":Online Appendix}.{p_end}

{pstd}Alaska and Hawaii are rescaled and moved to the bottom left of the map, below the continental US, for ease of viewing.{p_end}
